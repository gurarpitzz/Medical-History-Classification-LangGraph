- Prompts the user for symptoms
- Classifies symptoms using LLM-based reasoning
- Routes the patient to the correct medical department

It demonstrates:
- Use of **LangGraph** to build modular, stateful workflows
- Integration with **Gemini** via `langchain-google-genai`
- Graph-based logic with **conditional branching**
